# Zeipt Ionic App
Is an example app made to showcase the API for Zeipt. //TODO: Add link
It's meant to document an example use-case for the API and provide examples for interacting with it.

This is not meant to be published to an app-store and used for the public, but it is still an example of a real-world app. //TODO: Add more information

Feel free to use any and all parts of this app and/or code in your own projects.
Attribution is appreciated but not required! //TODO: Revise?

## Installation
To run this app, you need the ionic framework installed. Instructions on how to set that up can be [found here](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).
Once you got ionic installed, clone this repo and cd into the directory.
When in the directory, run npm install to fetch all dependencies.
When npm install finishes, run ionic serve --platform=ios to build and run a dev version of the app.
