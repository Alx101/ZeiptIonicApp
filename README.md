# Zeipt Ionic App 
Is an example app made to showcase the API for Zeipt. //TODO: Add link
It's meant to document an example use-case for the API and provide examples for interacting with it.

This is not meant to be published to an app-store and used for the public, but it is still an example of a real-world app. //TODO: Add more information

Feel free to use any and all parts of this app and/or code in your own projects.
Attribution is appreciated but not required! //TODO: Revise?
